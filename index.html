        <h2>The Grand Adventure</h2>
        <h3>Goal: to redesign the UI of an existing webpage with a focus on 
        accessibility and responsiveness</h3>

      <h2>Analyzing Usability of the Original Page</h2>
      <h4>Selected Webpage:</h4>
      <div id="selectedPageContainer">
        <div id="webpageTextArea">
          <p>I redesigned the webpage for a non-profit organization called <b>The Grand Adventure</b>, which provides programming 
            for pediatric and adult cancer survivors. I chose this website because I am interested in the intersection between
            design and the healthcare industry, and since this organization is a small non-profit, I was interested in seeing 
            how I might be able to revise the existing interface.</p>
          <p>Note: the webpage was recently redesigned, but the original version that I redesigned can be found 
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231231112303/https://www.thegrandadventure.org/" target="_blank"

      <h4>Analyzing Usability Problems:</h4>
      <p>The webpage is not overly complex, but there are obstructions to efficiently navigating the page. The purpose of this 
        website is to provide information to a user about the goals and purpose of this organization and its programs, but it 
        is difficult to figure out exactly what this organization does from the homepage based on the existing conceptual model, 
        which is very unstructured and does not strongly communicate to a user how it works.</p>
      <div id="usabilityAnalysis">
        <h5>Learnability</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Text describing the goal of the organization is on the page, but there is not a clear flow, hierarchy, or subdivisions 
            when scrolling down the page, making it challenging for first time users to navigate.
          </li>
          <li>
            When trying to learn about the organization and use this site, a user likely has to scroll all the way down the page 
            and go to other pages in order to piece together the information they are looking for.
          </li>
          <li>Text should be clearer, more descriptive, and more directly related to its designated section of the page</li>
          <li>Links could be more communicative to the user if visually responsive using color change on hover</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Efficiency</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>The images distract from the information on the page and don’t directly relate to the surrounding text.</li>
          <li>Much of the informative text is too small; not given enough emphasis through typography; uses inconsistent 
            fonts throughout. This (along with the lack of subdivisions) makes page navigation inefficient.</li>
          <li>The majority of the webpage is not very reflective of the organization itself or its identity (e.g. through 
            color, typography, branding)</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Memorability</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Beyond the images from the organization program itself, there is nothing distinguishable or memorable about 
            the site that relates to the organization</li>
            <li>Lacks cohesion (for instance, there is no consistent use of color or font)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <h4>Accessibility:</h4>
      <p>Using WebAIM WAVE, various contrast errors were indicated in regards to the text and background colors. 
        Additionally, there are errors regarding certain HTML classifications and alternative text labeling. I 
        agree that the low contrast of the text does result in some areas being more difficult to read and that 
        revised alt-text labeling would help boost this webpage’s usability.</p>

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <h3>Using HTML and CSS, I implemented the high-fidelity prototypes.<br>
      The deployed webpage can be viewed <a href="https://alexhogue.github.io/responsive-redesign/" 
      target="_blank" style="color: #DB7C0E;"><u id="deployed">here</u></a>.</h3>
      <p>The implemented page was tested at various screen sizes for responsiveness. Additionally, I tested the 
        page’s accessibility using WebAIM WAVE. The page passed all of the accessibility checks besides one contrast error 
        regarding the title contrast against the background image. However, I added additional features to aid in the
        contrast such as adding a dark shadow behind the title text and darkening the background image. I also ensured that the 
        contrast of this area was sufficient by testing it with black and white filters as well as color blind filters.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="conclusion">
      <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
      <p>This redesign process highlights the importance of addressing usability issues in design while prioritizing accessibility and visual 
        coherence. Restructuring the information architecture of the original page provided a clearer flow and hierarchy, and descriptive 
        and well-organized text, paired with visually responsive buttons, contributes to a more efficient user experience. I also 
        made an effort to enhance memorability by creating a cohesive visual identity that not only reflects the organization's 
        identity but also contributes to a more immersive experience for users. Accessibility was emphasized with the 
        implementation of high-contrast text and appropriate labeling for screen readers, ensuring that the webpage is accessible 
        to a broad audience. The implementation phase then brought the mockups to life to create a responsive webpage that adapts 
        seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.</p>
        <p>My goal was to not only create an aesthetically pleasing interface but to significantly enhance the user 
        experience, making information easily accessible to a diverse audience and ensuring that individuals can easily engage 
        with the organization's mission and programs. The process of redesigning the webpage was a valuable exploration into 
        the intersection of design, healthcare, and accessibility.</p>
