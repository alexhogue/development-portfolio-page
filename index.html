      <h2>Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
      <h4>Selected Webpage:</h4>
      <div id="selectedPageContainer">
        <div id="webpageTextArea">
          <p>I redesigned the webpage for a non-profit organization called <b>The Grand Adventure</b>, which provides programming 
            for pediatric and adult cancer survivors. I chose this website because I am interested in the intersection between
            design and the healthcare industry, and since this organization is a small non-profit, I was interested in seeing 
            how I might be able to revise the existing interface.</p>
          <p>Note: the webpage was recently redesigned, but the original version that I redesigned can be found 
          <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231231112303/https://www.thegrandadventure.org/" target="_blank" 
          style="color: #DB7C0E;"><u>here</u></a>.</p>

      <h4>Analyzing Usability Problems:</h4>
      <p>The webpage is not overly complex, but there are obstructions to efficiently navigating the page. The purpose of this 
        website is to provide information to a user about the goals and purpose of this organization and its programs, but it 
        is difficult to figure out exactly what this organization does from the homepage based on the existing conceptual model, 
        which is very unstructured and does not strongly communicate to a user how it works.</p>
      <h5>Learnability</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Text describing the goal of the organization is on the page, but there is not a clear flow, hierarchy, or subdivisions 
          when scrolling down the page, making it challenging for first time users to navigate.
        </li>
        <li>
          When trying to learn about the organization and use this site, a user likely has to scroll all the way down the page 
          and go to other pages in order to piece together the information they are looking for.
        </li>
        <li>Text should be clearer, more descriptive, and more directly related to its designated section of the page</li>
        <li>Links could be more communicative to the user if visually responsive using color change on hover</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Efficiency</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The images distract from the information on the page and don’t directly relate to the surrounding text.</li>
        <li>Much of the informative text is too small; not given enough emphasis through typography; uses inconsistent 
          fonts throughout. This (along with the lack of subdivisions) makes page navigation inefficient.</li>
        <li>The majority of the webpage is not very reflective of the organization itself or its identity (e.g. through 
          color, typography, branding)</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Memorability</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Beyond the images from the organization program itself, there is nothing distinguishable or memorable about 
          the site that relates to the organization</li>
          <li>Lacks cohesion (for instance, there is no consistent use of color or font)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Accessibility:</h4>
      <p>Using WebAIM WAVE, various contrast errors were indicated in regards to the text and background colors. 
        Additionally, there are errors regarding certain HTML classifications and alternative text labeling. I 
        agree that the low contrast of the text does result in some areas being more difficult to read and that 
        revised alt text labeling would help boost this webpage’s usability.</p>
